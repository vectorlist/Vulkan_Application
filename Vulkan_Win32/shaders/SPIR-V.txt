SPIR-V Toolchain
The LunarG Vulkan SDK includes tools and files for shader generation, inspection and compression improvement.

SPIR-V is a new binary intermediate representation for graphical shaders and compute kernels. This new intermediate representation has many advantages. The advantages and a high-level description of the representation are detailed in the SPIR-V white paper included in the SDK. The SPIR-V provisional specification for the version supported by the SDK is also included. These documents are located in $VULKAN_SDK/doc/khronos/spirv/ (Linux) and $VK_SDK_PATH\Doc (Windows).

The Vulkan graphics API requires that all shaders be presented in SPIR-V format. As a binary format, it cannot easily be manually created. SPIR-V shaders can be automatically created from equivalent GLSL shaders using the glslangValidator tool. The SPIR-V code can be read from the file into an application's memory and directly passed to the Vulkan API call vkCreateShader().

The SDK includes a SPIR-V disassembler named spirv for debugging Vulkan applications. This disassembler can create a human-readable text from a SPIR-V file. This text represents the SPIR-V program in terms of SPIR-V objects. Note that the text is not an assembly language, and that the Vulkan SDK does not contain a program which can re-assemble the text into a binary SPIR-V program.

Some Vulkan application publishers will wish to include many SPIR-V files in their distribution package. The Vulkan SDK also includes spirv-remap, a tool to improve the compressibility of collections of SPIR-V modules. This can result in up to a 50% reduction in the size of a compressed collection relative to the compressed originals, depending on the nature of the modules.

GLSL Validator

The LunarG Intel sample Vulkan ICD supports the SPIR-V intermediate shading language. glslangValidator is the tool used to validate GLSL shaders and optionally generate the equivalent SPIR-V form for each shader. Applications would ship with the SPIR-V files.

Executed without any options, glslangValidator returns the message:

Usage: glslangValidator [option]... [file]...

Where: each 'file' ends in .<stage>, where <stage> is one of
    .conf   to provide an optional config file that replaces the default configuration
            (see -c option below for generating a template)
    .vert   for a vertex shader
    .tesc   for a tessellation control shader
    .tese   for a tessellation evaluation shader
    .geom   for a geometry shader
    .frag   for a fragment shader
    .comp   for a compute shader

Compilation warnings and errors will be printed to stdout.

To get other information, use one of the following options:
Each option must be specified separately.
  -V          create SPIR-V binary, under Vulkan semantics; turns on -l;
              default file name is <stage>.spv (-o overrides this)
              (unless -o is specified, which overrides the default file name)
  -G          create SPIR-V binary, under OpenGL semantics; turns on -l;
              default file name is <stage>.spv (-o overrides this)
  -H          print human readable form of SPIR-V; turns on -V
  -E          print pre-processed GLSL; cannot be used with -l;
              errors will appear on stderr.
  -c          configuration dump;
              creates the default configuration file (redirect to a .conf file)
  -d          default to desktop (#version 110) when there is no shader #version
              (default is ES version 100)
  -h          print this usage message
  -i          intermediate tree (glslang AST) is printed out
  -l          link all input files together to form a single module
  -m          memory leak mode
  -o  <file>  save binary into <file>, requires a binary option (e.g., -V)
  -q          dump reflection query database
  -r          relaxed semantic error-checking mode
  -s          silent mode
  -t          multi-threaded mode
  -v          print version strings
  -w          suppress warnings (except as required by #extension : warn)
SPIR-V Disassembler and Assembler

A programmer may wish to view or change the contents of a shader while debugging a Vulkan application. Since Vulkan accepts shaders only in SPIR-V, a binary format, the SDK provides spirv-dis, a standalone program which prints a SPIR-V shader in human-readable and parsable form, and spirv-as, which can assemble the possibly edited output of spirv-dis.

spirv-dis -h returns the message:

./spirv-dis - Disassemble a SPIR-V binary module

Usage: ./spirv-dis [options] [<filename>]

The SPIR-V binary is read from <filename>. If no file is specified,
or if the filename is "-", then the binary is read from standard input.

Options:

  -h, --help      Print this help.
  --version       Display disassembler version information.

  -o <filename>   Set the output filename.
                  Output goes to standard output if this option is
                  not specified, or if the filename is "-".

  --no-color      Don't print in color.
                  The default when output goes to a file.

  --no-indent     Don't indent instructions.

  --offsets       Show byte offsets for each instruction.
spirv-as -h returns the message:

./spirv-as - Create a SPIR-V binary module from SPIR-V assembly text

Usage: ./spirv-as [options] <filename>

The SPIR-V assembly text is read from <filename>.  The SPIR-V binary
module is written to file "out.spv", unless the -o option is used.

Options:

  -h              Print this help.

  -o <filename>   Set the output filename.
  --version       Display assembler version information.
SPIR-V Remapper

The SPIR-V Remapper tool, spirv-remap, enhances compression of SPIR-V binary files via entropy reduction, including optional stripping of debug information and dead functions. spirv-remap transforms SPIR-V to SPIR-V, remapping IDs to reduce the size of a compressed image containing multiple SPIR-V modules. This works with compression procedures that can find dictionary entries across multiple files.

The SPIR-V Remapper supports two modes of use: command line and a C++11 API.

Remapping is accomplished via ID canonicalization. In this scheme, IDs become larger and are no longer tightly packed near zero, but should compress better when multiple modules are compressed together. The command line tool operates serially on multiple modules. The API accepts only a single module at a time.

Note: The spirv-remap tool is in early stages of development and should be considered alpha quality.

Command Line

spirv-remap supports multiple levels of verbosity, specified with -v, -vv, -vvv, etc or by providing an integer parameter to the --verbose option. Note that higher levels of verbosity provide a considerable quantity of stdout messages. With no verbosity, spirv-remap is silent, returning 0 on success and a positive integer error status on error.

The SPIR-V remapper provides basic ID remapping, ID remapping with debug symbol and line number stripping, and ID remapping with those features plus dead function and type elimination.

Executed without any options, spirv-remap returns a message similar to:

Usage: 
  spirv-remap [-v[v[...]] | --verbose [int]] [--map (all|types|names|funcs)] [--dce (all|types|funcs)] [--opt (all|loadstore)] [--strip-all | --strip all | -s] [--do-everything] --input | -i file1 [file2...] --output|-o DESTDIR
  spirv-remap [--version | -V]
  spirv-remap [--help | -?]
Options supported by spirv-remap are identified in the table below. Options can appear anywhere on the command line.

Option	Description
--dce	dead code elimination mode; eliminates dead functions and types
-i, --input	*.spv shader input files
--map	remap types, names, functions, or all
-o, --output	write remapped shader files to this directory
-s, --strip-all	strip debug symbol information and line numbers
Examples:

Basic ID remapping example:

spirv-remap --map all --input *.spv --output /tmp/out_dir
Performs ID remapping on all shaders in the current directory, writing new files with the same basenames to /tmp/out_dir.

ID remapping with debug symbol and line number stripping:

spirv-remap --map all --strip-all --input *.spv --output /tmp/out_dir
ID remapping with debug symbol and line number stripping plus dead function and type elimination:

spirv-remap --map all --dce all --strip-all --input *.spv --output /tmp/out_dir
API

API access to the SPIR-V Remapper may be provided in future SDKs.
